High Voltage Power Distribution I worked on the firmware for the battery management system and the battery contactor controller.
I designed the firmware to be robust and readable. I believe that safety-critical code should be easy to understand and as simple as possible.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://example.org/home/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/home/projects/</guid><description> Here are some projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on&amp;hellip; CAN Bootloader MKV BMS Contactor Control Kalman Filter SoC Estimation</description></item><item><title/><link>http://example.org/home/projects/can-bootloader/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/home/projects/can-bootloader/</guid><description>CAN Bootloader A bootloader that can reprogram chips using CAN.

Historically, whenever we wanted to update the firmware on our circuit boards, we had to use an in-system programming (ISP) dongle and plug into each board manually.
This often meant opening up enclosure, and required us to have a large programming header on each board, adding height and exposed copper.
As a personal project, I developed a bootloader for the ATmega16m1, the microcontroller we use on the team, that allows us to update the firmware of any ECU on our CAN bus.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://example.org/home/projects/bms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/home/projects/bms/</guid><description>MKV BMS A battery management system for a 400V EV battery.

For the Olin Electric Motorsports MKV vehicle, we had a 400V battery pack built with 864 18650 lithium batteries.
In order to ensure safe operation, we built a custom BMS. A few of my teammates worked on the electrical systems and PCBs, and I wrote the firmware.
The BMS core uses isoSPI to communicate with peripheral boards, each containing two LTC6811 battery management integrated chips.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://example.org/home/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/home/contact/</guid><description>Contact Email: j &amp;lt;at&amp;gt; jackgreenberg &amp;lt;dot&amp;gt; co
