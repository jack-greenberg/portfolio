PCB called the <em>Brake System Plausibility Device</em>, or BSPD.</p><p>This is a safety-critical board that will shutdown the car if power is being
delivered to the motor while the brake pedal is pressed for longer than half a
second. The throttle system should prevent torque requests during braking, but
this circuit acts as a fail-safe.</p></section><section><div style=text-align:right><img src=/telemetry-radio.png width=40% style=border:none;box-shadow:none;margin-bottom:-7em;margin-top:-7em></div><h1 id=year-2>Year 2</h1><p>As a sophomore, I founded and led the telemetry subteam. We worked on a system
to stream data from our vehicle&rsquo;s CAN bus to an off-board computer in real-time.
I led the system design and worked with other senior engineers to execute
testing and an initial implementation of the system.</p><p>This was during a remote year (due to the Covid-19 pandemic), so keeping members
engaged proved to be the biggest challenge. But through team bonding events,
regular meetings and 1:1s, we were able to lay a solid foundation for the
following year.</p></section><section><div style=text-align:right><img src=/air-minus.jpg width=30% style=border:none;box-shadow:none;margin-bottom:-6em;margin-top:-6em></div><h1 id=year-3>Year 3</h1><p>As a junior, I decided to revamp our entire system for writing firmware and
designing PCBs. This included a lot of projects:</p><ul><li><p>I moved the team to a <a href=https://github.com/olin-electric-motorsports/olin-electric-motorsports>monorepo</a> that has all of our electrical and software
work.</p></li><li><p>I collaborated with teammates on a system to describe our CAN bus using a YAML
spec that would be compiled into a DBC file as well as generated into a C
library.</p></li><li><p>I worked on revamping our entire firmware system, including writing libraries
for SPI, UART, CAN, ADC, timers, and more for our microcontroller, and rewrote
most of our firmware images to use these libraries.</p></li></ul><p>This was a busy year&mldr;</p></section><section><h1 id=year-4>Year 4</h1><p>As a senior, I decided to scale back my technical contributions to the team in
favor of engaging in <em>knowledge transfer</em>. Over the summer, I led a series of
sessions in which I taught the incoming electrical subteam leads about the
fundementals of embedded systems and how to write low-level code. I also led
talks on the systems of our car including high-voltage power distribution.</p><p>I also took on the role of financial manager on the team, organizing a $65,000
budget. My goal is to be as transparent as possible with the rest of the team as
well as with Olin College, and I achieved this by organizing regular financial
updates and keeping in close contact with the Olin finance offices.</p></section></section><section data-noprocess data-shortcode-slide id=projects data-name=Projects><h3 id=here-are-some-projects-ive-worked-on>Here are some projects I&rsquo;ve worked on&mldr;</h3><br><h4 id=electrical>Electrical</h4><p><a href=#scope-pcb><strong>SCOPE PCB</strong></a>.

team had little experience in harness design or construction, so the result was
a rat&rsquo;s nest of cabling with no wire protection. This led to issues like wires
getting pinched and shorting power supplies (through fuses, of course) to
ground.</p><p>When we took the car to competition, this was the biggest source of feedback
from the judges. Something needed to change for our next vehicle, MKVI.</p></section><section><div style=display:flex;flex-direction:row;align-items:center><div style="flex:1 0 60%;margin-right:2rem"><p>Over the course of a semester, I taught myself the software <em>RapidHarness</em> and

our circuit boards, we had to use an <em>in-system programming (ISP) dongle</em> and
plug into each board manually.</p><p>This often meant opening up enclosures, and required us to have a large
programming header on each board, adding height and exposed copper.</p></section><section><p>I developed a bootloader for the ATmega16m1, the microcontroller we use on the
team, that allows us to update the firmware of <em>any</em> ECU on our CAN bus.</p><br><p>This means:</p><ul><li>No more programming dongles</li><li>No more opening enclosures</li><li>No more large programming headers</li></ul></section><section><p>The bootloader runs when the chip receives power, checks EEPROM for a validity
stamp on the image, and then boots into either the image or the updater.</p><p>The updater uses a state-based approach for doing firmware updates. You can find
a diagram for the state machine <a href=/btldr-state.png target=_blank>here</a>.</p><p>I also wrote a Python client that handles all interaction with the bootloader. I
implemented a command-line interface that engineers can use to manually ping and
firmware-update the boards, but the client is application-agnostic and could
just as easily be used in, for example, a continuous integration setup.</p></section></section><section data-shortcode-section><section data-noprocess data-shortcode-slide id=air-control><h1 id=air-control>AIR Control</h1><p><em>High-voltage power distribution for an EV.</em></p><p><a href=https://github.com/olin-electric-motorsports/olin-electric-motorsports/tree/main/vehicle/mkv/software/air_control>Code repository</a>.

(which we call <em>AIR Control</em> <small>1</small>). Because it is a safety-critical
system, I put a lot of focus on simplicity and robustness.</p><p>The system is implemented as a state machine and goes through precharging the
capacitance in the motor controller and handles fourteen possible faults.</p><br><p><small>1: AIR stands for <strong>accumulator isolation relay</strong></small></p></section><section><p>I also designed a test rig that simulates the inputs to the microcontroller and
reads outputs over both GPIO and CAN. Tests are written in Python and fully
exercise the state machine.</p><p>The code is highly organized and commented so as to be simple to read and
