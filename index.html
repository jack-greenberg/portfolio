embedded controls software intern at Apple in the Special Projects Group in
Sunnyvale, California.</p><p>I am under a strict NDA, but can say that I was an embedded software controls
engineer building a product that has not reached the market.</p><p>I worked closely with electrical, mechanical, and controls engineers to develop
integrated engineering systems, and developed firmware drivers for interfacing
with sensors and other hardware peripherals.</p></section><section><div><img style="display:inline;vertical-align:text-bottom;border:none;box-shadow:none;margin:0 .5em 0 0" src=/indico.png width=7%><h2 style=display:inline>Indico AI</h2><p style=font-size:.75em>Back-End Software Intern | May-Aug 2020</p></div><p>My first college internship was at Indico, a startup that works on
machine-learning solutions for document processing. I worked on their back-end
systems, which comprised of a set of microservices.</p><p>My main project was developing a cache using Redis for validating permissions
for a request across all the microservices. You can read more about it <a href=#permission-cache>here</a>.</p><p>This internship taught me a lot about professional software engineering and
distributed systems. While back-end isn&rsquo;t the field I work in anymore, I still
use skills I learned from Indico everyday.</p></section><section><div><img style="display:inline;vertical-align:text-bottom;border:none;box-shadow:none;margin:0 .5em 0 0" src=/yay-brigade.png width=7%><h2 style=display:inline>Yay Brigade</h2><p style=font-size:.75em>Full-stack Software Intern | Jan-Aug 2019</p></div><p>I worked at Yay Brigade, a small design firm in downtown Los Angeles, during my
gap year before college. I worked closely with Roman, the co-founder, as well as
various visiting designers. We worked on websites for various groups in Los
Angeles.</p><p>I also started exploring back-end software while at Yay Brigade. I built a tool
called <strong>Status</strong> that displayed a list of the websites and whether or not they
were online. It would email us after a site had been down for longer than an
hour.</p></section></section><section data-shortcode-section><section data-noprocess data-shortcode-slide data-background-image=/mkv.png data-background-position="left bottom" data-background-repeat=no-repeat data-background-size=65%><div style=text-align:left><p><img style=border:none;box-shadow:none;margin:0 src=/oem-logo.png width=30%></p><p>At Olin, I&rsquo;m a member of <a href=https://www.olinelectricmotorsports.com><strong>Olin Electric

PCB called the <em>Brake System Plausibility Device</em>, or BSPD.</p><p>This is a safety-critical board that will shutdown the car if power is being
delivered to the motor while the brake pedal is pressed for longer than half a
second. The throttle system should prevent torque requests during braking, but
this circuit acts as a fail-safe.</p></section><section><div style=text-align:right><img src=/telemetry-radio.png width=40% style=border:none;box-shadow:none;margin-bottom:-7em;margin-top:-7em></div><h1 id=year-2>Year 2</h1><p>As a sophomore, I founded and led the telemetry subteam. We worked on a system
to stream data from our vehicle&rsquo;s CAN bus to an off-board computer in real-time.
I led the system design and worked with other senior engineers to execute
testing and an initial implementation of the system.</p><p>This was during a remote year (due to the Covid-19 pandemic), so keeping members
engaged proved to be the biggest challenge. But through team bonding events,
regular meetings and 1:1s, we were able to lay a solid foundation for the
following year.</p></section><section><h1 id=year-3>Year 3</h1><p>As a junior, I decided to revamp our entire system for writing firmware and
designing PCBs. This included a lot of projects:</p><ul><li><p>I moved the team to a <a href=https://github.com/olin-electric-motorsports/olin-electric-motorsports>monorepo</a> that has all of our electrical and software
work.</p></li><li><p>I collaborated with teammates on a system to describe our CAN bus using a YAML
spec that would be compiled into a DBC file as well as generated into a C
library.</p></li><li><p>I worked on revamping our entire firmware system, including writing libraries
for SPI, UART, CAN, ADC, timers, and more for our microcontroller, and rewrote
most of our firmware images to use these libraries.</p></li></ul><p>This was a busy year&mldr;</p></section><section><h1 id=year-4>Year 4</h1><p>As a senior, I decided to scale back my technical contributions to the team in
favor of engaging in <em>knowledge transfer</em>. Over the summer, I led a series of
sessions in which I taught the incoming electrical subteam leads about the
fundementals of embedded systems and how to write low-level code. I also led
talks on the systems of our car including high-voltage power distribution.</p><p>I also took on the role of financial manager on the team, organizing a $65,000
budget. My goal is to be as transparent as possible with the rest of the team as
well as with Olin College, and I achieved this by organizing regular financial
updates and keeping in close contact with the Olin finance offices.</p></section><section><div style=text-align:right><img src=/service-section.jpg width=50% style=border:none;box-shadow:none;margin-bottom:-4rem;margin-top:-4em></div><div style=text-align:left><h3 id=high-voltage-power-distribution>High Voltage Power Distribution</h3><p>I worked on the firmware for the <a href=#mkv-bms>battery management system</a> and the

safety-critical code should be easy to understand and as simple as possible.</p></div></section><section><div style=text-align:left><h4 id=battery-contactor-control>Battery Contactor Control</h4><p>I implemented a state machine for controlling the battery contactors (also
called AIRs, or <em>accumulator isolation relays</em>). The firmware ensures safe
operation of the motor controller (precharge, discharge).</p><p>The entire state machine was fully tested using a pieced-together
hardware-in-the-loop test setup with a CAN dongle, an Arduino, and a <strong>lot</strong> of
jumper cables.</p><p>The state machine is diagrammed below.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/olin-electric-motorsports/olin-electric-motorsports/tree/main/vehicle/mkv/software/air_control>Code repository</a>.

a C-source generator that provides us an API for sending and receiving the

our circuit boards, we had to use an <em>in-system programming (ISP) dongle</em> and
plug into each board manually.</p><p>This often meant opening up enclosures, and required us to have a large
programming header on each board, adding height and exposed copper.</p></section><section><p>I developed a bootloader for the ATmega16m1, the microcontroller we use on the
team, that allows us to update the firmware of <em>any</em> ECU on our CAN bus.</p><br><p>This means:</p><ul><li>No more programming dongles</li><li>No more opening enclosures</li><li>No more large programming headers</li></ul></section><section><p>The bootloader runs when the chip receives power, checks EEPROM for a validity
stamp on the image, and then boots into either the image or the updater.</p><p>The updater uses a state-based approach for doing firmware updates. You can find
a diagram for the state machine <a href=/btldr-state.png target=_blank>here</a>.</p><p>The bootloader is accompanied by a Python client and CLI that allows users to
ping and firmware-update the boards based on a preset ECU ID.</p></section></section><section data-shortcode-section><section data-noprocess data-shortcode-slide id=bms><h1 id=mkv-bms>MKV BMS</h1><p><em>A battery management system for a 400V EV battery.</em></p><p><a href=https://github.com/olin-electric-motorsports/olin-electric-motorsports/tree/main/vehicle/mkv/software/bms>Code repository</a>.

motor controller. However, connecting it directly is dangerous for the system—we
can end up with a massive surge of current and potentially weld our contactors
shut.</p></section><section><p>On our Formula team, I rewrote the firmware for the contactor control system
(which we call <em>AIR Control</em> <small>1</small>). Because it is a safety-critical
system, I put a lot of focus on simplicity and robustness.</p><p>The system is implemented as a state machine and goes through precharging the
capacitance in the motor controller and handles fourteen possible faults.</p><br><p><small>1: AIR stands for <strong>accumulator isolation relay</strong></small></p></section><section><p>I also designed a test rig that simulates the inputs to the microcontroller and
reads outputs over both GPIO and CAN. Tests are written in Python and fully
exercise the state machine.</p><p>The code is highly organized and commented so as to be simple to read and
straightforward to understand. This is important because safety-critical systems
need to be auditable and easily parseable by a human.</p></section></section><section data-noprocess data-shortcode-slide id=contact><h2 id=contact>Contact</h2><p>Email: <a href=mailto:j@jackgreenberg.co>j@jackgreenberg.co</a></p><p>Github: <a href=https://github.com/jack-greenberg>@jack-greenberg</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=https://twitter.com/jackgreenb/>@jackgreenb</a></p><br><br><p>To go back to the first slide, just press <code>Shift</code> ←</p></section></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=/reveal-hugo/object-assign.js></script>
