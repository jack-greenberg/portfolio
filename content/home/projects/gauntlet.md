For my Quantitative Engineering Analysis course (sophomore year), the goal of
the final project was to navigate a simulated Roomba-like robot through a world
called The Gauntlet, avoiding obstacles (boxes) until finally reaching the goal
(cylinder).

---

The robot was equiped with a LIDAR camera that sampled points around it. I used
a *random sample consensus (RANSAC)* algorithm to organize the individual points
from LIDAR into a series of lines and a circle (the goal).

From the lines and the circle, the code then generated a vector field and then
apply _gradient descent_ to navigate the robot towards the goal.
