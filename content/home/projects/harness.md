On our Formula team's MKV vehicle, the wire harness was a massive sore spot. The
team had little experience in harness design or construction, so the result was
a rat's nest of cabling with no wire protection. This led to issues like wires
getting pinched and shorting power supplies (through fuses, of course) to
ground.

When we took the car to competition, this was the biggest source of feedback
from the judges. Something needed to change for our next vehicle, MKVI.

Over the course of a semester, I taught myself the software _RapidHarness_ and
spent hours researching best practices in harness design. I landed our team a
sponsorship from AlphaWire who provided all of our 14 and 20AWG wire and,
through trial and error, taught myself and the rest of the team how to build a
harness.

The result was neat, robust, and discrete.
