For the Olin Electric Motorsports MKV vehicle, we had a 400V battery pack built
with 864 _18650_ lithium batteries.

In order to ensure safe operation, we built a custom BMS. A few of my teammates
worked on the electrical systems and PCBs, and I wrote the firmware.

---

The BMS core uses isoSPI to communicate with peripheral boards, each containing
two LTC6811 battery management integrated chips.

I adapted Linear Technology's (now Analog Devices) drivers to fit our
microcontrollers, and implemented a 100 Hz loop that monitors the temperatures
and voltages.

---

In the future, I'm planning on taking things to the next level.

I'm planning to integrate state-of-charge estimation using an extended Kalman
filter algorithm, and integrate control loops to dynamically limit torque as a
function of battery temperature.
