# CAN Bootloader

_A bootloader that can reprogram chips using CAN._

Historically, on our Formula team, whenever we wanted to update the firmware on
our circuit boards, we had to use an _in-system programming (ISP) dongle_ and
plug into each board manually.

This often meant opening up enclosures, and required us to have a large
programming header on each board, adding height and exposed copper.

I developed a bootloader for the ATmega16m1, the microcontroller we use on the
team, that allows us to update the firmware of _any_ ECU on our CAN bus.

<br />

This means:

* No more programming dongles
* No more opening enclosures
* No more large programming headers

---

The bootloader runs when the chip receives power, checks EEPROM for a validity
stamp on the image, and then boots into either the image or the updater.

The updater uses a state-based approach for doing firmware updates. You can find
a diagram for the state machine <a href="/btldr-state.png" target="_blank">here</a>.

The bootloader is accompanied by a Python client and CLI that allows users to
ping and firmware-update the boards based on a preset ECU ID.
