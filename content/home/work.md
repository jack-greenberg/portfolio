<p style="font-size: .75em">Embedded Controls Software Intern | May-Aug 2022, Jan-Aug 2021</p>
</div>

I spent the last two summers (as well as a semester off from school) as an
embedded controls software intern at Apple in the Special Projects Group in
Sunnyvale, California.

I am under a strict NDA, but can say that I was an embedded software controls
engineer building a product that has not reached the market.

I worked closely with electrical, mechanical, and controls engineers to develop
integrated engineering systems, and developed firmware drivers for interfacing
with sensors and other hardware peripherals.

<p style="font-size: .75em">Back-End Software Intern | May-Aug 2020</p>
</div>

My first college internship was at Indico, a startup that works on
machine-learning solutions for document processing. I worked on their back-end
systems, which comprised of a set of microservices.

My main project was developing a cache using Redis for validating permissions
for a request across all the microservices. You can read more about it [here].

[here]: #permission-cache

This internship taught me a lot about professional software engineering and
distributed systems. While back-end isn't the field I work in anymore, I still
use skills I learned from Indico everyday.

<p style="font-size: .75em">Full-stack Software Intern | Jan-Aug 2019</p>
</div>

I worked at Yay Brigade, a small design firm in downtown Los Angeles, during my
gap year before college. I worked closely with Roman, the co-founder, as well as
various visiting designers. We worked on websites for various groups in Los
Angeles.

I also started exploring back-end software while at Yay Brigade. I built a tool
called **Status** that displayed a list of the websites and whether or not they
were online. It would email us after a site had been down for longer than an
hour.
