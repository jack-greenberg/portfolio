Zipline's **Platform 2** drone consists of two vehicles: a zip, which is the
hovering drone; and a droid, a small delivery robot stowed in the zip that is
lowered by winch to drop off the package.

My intern project was to design, develop, and test **zip-to-droid
communications**. The vehicles communicate things like motion commands and
vehicle state over a wireless link. The code was entirely written in Rust.

In addition to the design, I also spent time collecting performance metrics like
latency. The data analysis, in addition to some probabilistic modeling, proved
that the solution was able to meet worst-case latency requirements while
balancing wireless channel utilization.

<p style="font-size: .75em">Embedded Controls Software Intern | May-Aug 2022, Jan-Aug 2021</p>
</div>

I spent the two summers (as well as a semester off from school) as an
embedded controls software intern at Apple in the Special Projects Group in
Sunnyvale, California.

I am under a strict NDA, but can say that I was an embedded software controls
engineer building a product that has not reached the market.

I worked closely with electrical, mechanical, and controls engineers to develop
integrated engineering systems, and developed firmware drivers for interfacing
with sensors and other hardware peripherals.

<h2 style="display: inline">Indico AI</h2>

<p style="font-size: .75em">Back-End Software Intern | May-Aug 2020</p>
</div>

My first college internship was at Indico, a startup that works on
machine-learning solutions for document processing. I worked on their back-end
systems, which comprised of a set of microservices.

My main project was developing a cache using Redis for validating permissions
for a request across all the microservices. You can read more about it [here].

This internship taught me a lot about professional software engineering and
distributed systems. While back-end isn't the field I work in anymore, I still
use skills I learned from Indico everyday.

<p style="font-size: .75em">Full-stack Software Intern | Jan-Aug 2019</p>
</div>

I worked at Yay Brigade, a small design firm in downtown Los Angeles, during my
gap year before college. I worked closely with Roman, the co-founder, as well as
various visiting designers. We worked on websites for various groups in Los
Angeles.

I also started exploring back-end software while at Yay Brigade. I built a tool
called **Status** that displayed a list of the websites and whether or not they
were online. It would email us after a site had been down for longer than an
hour.

# Skills

I'm well-versed in all layers of the stack, from web development to bare-metal
firmware to PCB design.

I am also a skilled technical communicator, from [design reviews] to [bug
reports] to [project documentation]. I gave the final presentation for my senior
capstone on behalf of my team, check it out [here].

[design reviews]: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yDIXdgj3lLqJSEwJy6zv_iMa3pMJ1Nxz0eXIxtiBIpw/edit?usp=sharing
[bug reports]: https://github.com/olin-electric-motorsports/olin-electric-motorsports/pull/196#issue-1472232261
