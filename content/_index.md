electrical and computer engineering.

My focus is in _embedded systems engineering_.

I'm currently interning at Apple in the Special Projects Group.

I am under a strict NDA, but can say that I was an embedded software controls
engineer building a product that has not reached the market.

I worked closely with electrical, mechanical, and controls engineers to develop
integrated engineering systems, and developed firmware drivers for interfacing
with sensors and other hardware peripherals.
