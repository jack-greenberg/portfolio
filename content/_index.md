## Education

In May 2023 I graduated from Olin College of Engineering with a B.S. in
Electrical and Computer Engineering. Well, sort of...

<br />

<small>More details ðŸ”½</small>

I didn't *technically* graduate<sup>\*</sup>.

During the pandemic, I took a semester off to do a co-op at Apple in the Special
Projects Group. Because of this, completion of my degree was delayed by <span style="white-space: nowrap">a semester</span>.

**However**, I decided that for my final semester, I would study abroad in
Italy. In August 2023, I'll be moving to Florence to take cooking classes to
satisfy a minor in <span style="white-space: nowrap">*culinary arts*</span>.

<br />

<small><sup>\*</sup>Though I did walk across the stage and receive an empty
diploma.</small>

At Olin, my notable coursework included:

* Introduction to Microelectronic Circuits
* Computer Architecture
* Analog and Digital Communications
* Software Systems
* Safe Embedded Systems Programming in Rust
* Quantitative Engineering Analysis
